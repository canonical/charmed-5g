# Charmed 5G

Charmed 5G is a secure, reliable and observable open source 5G network.

Charmed 5G is built using [Open Networking Foundation](https://opennetworking.org/) projects:
- **Charmed SD-Core**: A charmed distribution of ONF's SD-Core. It is a 5G core network, responsible for the 5G Network's control operations: Authentication, IP assignment, Policy management, Quality of Service, Slice management, and more.
- **Charmed SD-RAN**: A charmed distribution of ONF's SD-RAN. It is a 5G Radio Access Network built on the Open RAN architecture.

Charmed 5G exists because mobile networks are traditionally costly and difficult to operate and that open source alternatives are either too complex or unsecure. The project combines ONF's 5G expertise with Juju model driven operations.

Charmed 5G is for private mobile networks operators and all connectivity enthusiasts. Use it in your farm, mine or oil rig, wherever you need 5G connectivity.
